## About the Event

IEEE CS SBC CETkr successfully conducted a workshop on **Machine Learning** as a part of **Reviens 4.0** on 2nd November 2024. Over 70 students took part in this event, which was handled by Mr. Abhilash K P, an expert in the field of ML.

The workshop was open to all students irrespective of their year of study or college. The session was designed to introduce students to machine learning and provide a hands-on approach by creating simple models themselves. Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and machine learning, was utilized as the primary tool for model creation.

While the workshop faced some initial technical difficulties, the organizing team successfully resolved the issues and ensured the smooth continuation of the session. The comprehensive, day-long format allowed for in-depth coverage of the subject matter.

## Event Impact

The workshop received positive feedback from the participants, indicating its effectiveness. Information about the workshop and registration were provided along with the same for “Reviens 4.0”. The day-long session was very much informative and helpful as per the feedback received. Certificates were provided to the participants.
