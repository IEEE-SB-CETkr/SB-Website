## About the Event


The AutoCAD workshop was designed to introduce Civil Engineering students to the core concepts of computer-aided design and drafting. The session began with an overview of the AutoCAD interface, basic drawing tools, and essential commands. Participants were guided through hands-on exercises, including creating simple floor plans and structural layouts, which helped them understand the practical applications of the software in real-world engineering projects.

The workshop was split into two sessions. The morning session focused on the basics of AutoCAD, such as drawing lines, shapes, and using layers. After a lunch break at 12:30 PM, the afternoon session resumed at 2:00 PM and delved into more advanced features, including dimensioning, annotations, and plotting drawings. The interactive format encouraged students to ask questions and solve design challenges collaboratively.

Throughout the day, participants received personalized guidance from the instructor, ensuring that everyone could follow along regardless of their prior experience. The workshop emphasized the importance of precision and efficiency in engineering design, skills that are highly valued in the civil engineering industry.

Feedback from attendees was overwhelmingly positive. Many students appreciated the practical approach and the opportunity to work directly on AutoCAD, gaining confidence in their ability to use the software for academic and professional projects. The event concluded with a Q&A session, where students discussed further learning resources and career opportunities related to CAD.

By the end of the workshop, participants had developed a solid foundation in AutoCAD, empowering them to tackle future design tasks with greater competence and creativity.
