## About the Event

As part of REVIENS 4.0, a workshop on 'Circuit Design and Simulations using Proteus' was conducted by IEEE officials for EEE and ECE students on 2nd November 2024 at the College of Engineering Trikaripur. The main objective of the workshop was to provide participants with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively use Proteus software for designing and simulating electronic circuits.

The session began with an introduction to the Proteus interface and its key features. Participants learned how to create basic circuit schematics, add and configure components, and simulate circuit behavior in real time. The workshop included several hands-on exercises, allowing students to design, test, and troubleshoot their own circuits under the guidance of experienced instructors.

Throughout the day, students explored both analog and digital circuit simulations, gaining practical experience with tools essential for modern electronics engineering. The interactive format encouraged questions and collaborative problem-solving, making the learning process engaging and effective.

Nearly 80 participants attended the workshop, reflecting strong interest and enthusiasm for practical electronics and simulation tools. Feedback from attendees highlighted the clarity of instruction and the immediate applicability of the skills learned.
